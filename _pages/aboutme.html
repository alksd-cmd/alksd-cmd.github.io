    <p>Welcome! I’m Rais Fazriansyah, based in Majalengka, West Java, Indonesia. Although web development is a side job for me, it’s a true passion that I pursue with dedication. My main career path lies in a different field, but my love for technology and creativity keeps drawing me into web projects, which I work on in my spare time.</p>
    <p>I initially got into web development out of curiosity. The idea of creating something functional and visually appealing through code was fascinating. Starting from basic HTML and CSS, I gradually honed my skills and learned how websites are structured, how they look good, and how they can perform efficiently. What began as a simple interest has turned into a part-time venture, helping clients and friends build a strong online presence.</p>
    <p>Although I work on a part-time basis, I treat every project with full commitment and attention to detail. Let’s dive deeper into my journey, the skills I bring, and how web development became a fulfilling side gig for me.</p>

    <h2>My Background and How I Found Web Development</h2>
    <p>Growing up in Majalengka, I always had a natural curiosity about technology, even if it wasn’t my primary career goal. I remember spending hours experimenting with various software and exploring online tutorials. My first steps into web development happened almost by accident when I stumbled upon HTML tutorials while browsing.</p>
    <p>I started to experiment with basic codes, playing with colors, fonts, and simple layouts. It was thrilling to see the changes happen in real time on the browser, and I became hooked on the idea of creating websites. While my day job occupies most of my time, I always make room in my schedule for web development, as it’s something I genuinely enjoy.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I’ve expanded my skillset to include design principles, responsive layouts, and a bit of back-end work. Even though I’m mostly self-taught, my passion for learning has kept me moving forward, and I’ve built a small but meaningful portfolio along the way.</p>

    <h2>Skills I Bring to Every Project</h2>
    <p>Even though I’m a part-time web developer, I strive to deliver quality work by bringing a solid set of skills to each project. My core strengths lie in front-end design, where I aim to create visually appealing and functional layouts. I’m experienced in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I work with tools like Adobe XD and Figma to produce high-quality designs.</p>
    <p>Understanding responsive design is essential, and I always make sure that the websites I create look great on devices of all sizes. Whether it’s a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, my designs are user-friendly and accessible. I believe that good design is about making things look nice and ensuring that users have a seamless experience.</p>
    <p>In addition to design, I also handle fundamental back-end tasks to ensure that websites run smoothly. I have a keen interest in SEO, and I strive to make my clients’ websites reach their audience effectively. I continually update my skills to keep up with best practices, knowing that the web is constantly evolving.</p>

    <h2>My Approach to Web Development as a Side Gig</h2>
    <p>For many, web development might seem like a full-time job, but for me, it’s a creative outlet and a hobby that happens to generate income. Working on web projects in my spare time allows me to balance my primary career with something I truly enjoy. I find that having web development as a side job helps me stay motivated and keeps my skills sharp.</p>
    <p>Each project I take on offers a unique challenge, and I love how it allows me to think critically and creatively. I might spend my day working in a different field, but when I sit down to work on a website, it feels like a refreshing break. I approach every project with enthusiasm, even if I’m only dedicating part-time hours to it.</p>
    <p>Working on websites lets me connect with people from different backgrounds who need help building their online presence. Knowing that my skills can help someone achieve their goals is deeply satisfying, and it’s one of the reasons I’m committed to web development, despite my busy schedule.</p>

    <h2>Balancing Quality and Efficiency</h2>
    <p>One challenge of working as a part-time developer is balancing quality and efficiency. With limited hours, I focus on delivering high-quality work without compromising on time. I prioritize key elements, such as design, functionality, and responsiveness, ensuring that my clients get the most value out of each project.</p>
    <p>I believe in maintaining open communication with clients, setting realistic expectations, and being transparent about what can be achieved within the timeframe. This approach has helped me build trust with my clients, who appreciate the honesty and dedication I bring, even as a part-time developer.</p>
    <p>To manage my time effectively, I also stay organized and make use of tools that help streamline my workflow. By following a structured process, I can deliver results efficiently while keeping my projects aligned with clients’ visions and goals.</p>

    <h2>What Drives Me to Keep Learning</h2>
    <p>As someone who works part-time in web development, I’m constantly learning and staying updated with the latest trends. The tech world moves fast, and I love keeping up with new tools, frameworks, and techniques that can improve my work. My self-taught background has instilled in me the importance of lifelong learning.</p>
    <p>I regularly invest time in online courses, tutorials, and community forums to expand my knowledge. I find that each new skill or technique I learn adds value to my projects, enabling me to provide better solutions for my clients. My commitment to growth is what keeps my passion for web development alive.</p>
    <p>Whether it’s exploring new design trends or improving site performance, I embrace every learning opportunity with enthusiasm. Each project I take on is a chance to test my skills and learn something new, which is one of the most fulfilling aspects of web development.</p>

    <h2>What’s Next for Me</h2>
    <p>While web development is a side job, I am committed to building a meaningful portfolio. My goal is to continue growing as a developer, taking on projects that challenge and inspire me. I’m always open to collaborating with clients who value creativity, functionality, and a user-centered approach.</p>
    <p>As my skills develop, I hope to expand my services, offering more comprehensive solutions to clients. I envision creating websites that are not only visually appealing but also high-performing and effective in reaching target audiences. I’m excited to see where this journey will take me, and I am looking forward to new opportunities.</p>
    <p>My part-time work in web development is something I deeply enjoy, and I’m committed to making a positive impact with each project. Here’s to building, learning, and growing as a developer – one website at a time!</p>
